## About me
I'm Flynn, a first year graduate student from Santa Clara University(Master of Science in Computer Science and Engineering). I am a C++/Python developer, experienced in backend/server/client development. My interests include algorithm optimization, computer graphics, language model and OS&Network.

I completed my undergraduate studies at the School of Mathematics at South China University of Technology(China), majoring in Information and Computing Science(BS). Now, I am pursuing my CSE degree, hoping to combine mathematics and computers to create something truly useful to the world.
